A simple, light, and clean UI to write threads â€” built with Python and Streamlit.

## Motivation
I enjoy writing threads more than single posts because it lets me develop storytelling. However, I found the interface of X and third-party applications too distrating for the task. So I decided to use my recently acquired Python skills to build a simple, light, and clean UI to write and save threads locally. As a more-junior-than-junior developer building my first-ever app, expect a very rough code. 

## Features
* Automatically save and update your thread as a `thread_label.txt` local file
* Add subsequent text areas to your thread
* Text areas feature character count with a color warning when you exceed the 280 character limit
* Character count considers URL and emoji count exceptions
* Navigate to `Threads` to read and delete saved threads

## Installing knittingmachine

### Prerequisits
* [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation)

### Set up your environment
Regardless of which package management tool you're using, I recommend running the commands on this page in a virtual environment. This ensures that the dependencies pulled in for knittingmachine don't impact any other Python projects you're working on.

### Install and run knittingmachine
1. Navigate to your project directory:

    `cd your_project_directory`
2. Activate your virtual environment
3. Install project requirements:
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Test that you have Streamlit installed:
    
    `streamlit hello`
5. Streamlit's Hello app should appear in a new tab in your web browser! To stop the Streamlit server, press ctrl-C.
6. Create a local [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) of knittingmachine to your project directory:
    
    `git clone https://github.com/monicazng/knittingmachine`
7. Now you can use Python and Streamlit to run knittingmachine locally!
    
    `streamlit run app.py`
    A new tab in your web browser should pop up running knittingmachine locally!

Remember that this is app runs locally on your computer. 

## Limitations
* When the thread label is empty and a text area is edited, an empty name `.py` file is created with no warning and subsequent threads following this pattern will replace the content of previous threads with no thread label
* When the thread label is filled after a text area has been edited, a `thread_label.py` file is created but it won't show in the `Threads` dropdown until a new text area is created or the app is refreshed
* Since images don't affect the character count, they have been disregarded in this implementation

## Roadmap
- [X] Saved threads: add delete thread functionality
- [ ] New threads: add change text order functionality
- [ ] Saved threads: addd editing functionality
